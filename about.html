        <h2>ME & MY LIFE</h2>
        <p><strong>Hi! I’m Breeze,</strong> a student at USC in Los Angeles, majoring in Design, Technology, and
            Business, with a minor
            and planned masters in Computer Science. I was born and raised in Hawai’i, where the unique culture
            instilled in me a deep appreciation for community and the sacredness of nature.</p>
        <p><strong>Growing up on a 30 mile wide island</strong> surrounded by ocean, water sports were always a part of
            my day. Now, I’ve become a successful collegiate athlete in sailing, with a love for surfing, kiting, and
            windsurfing. These disciplines fueled my adventurous spirit and taught me invaluable lessons in dedication,
            work ethic, and teamwork. The ocean isn’t just a part of my life, its a part of my heart.</p>
        <p><strong>Volunteer work</strong> is a cornerstone of my life. I frequently engage in hands-on environmental
            protection initiatives and work with programs that empower young women in STEM. For the past eight years,
            I’ve been dedicated to saving turtles with Malama i na Honu. I’ve also championed environmental legislation,
            such as bill 40, which bans many single-use plastics in Hawai’i. In addition, through my work with Amnesty
            International, I raised funds that provided 5 people with a lifetime of clean water.</p>
        <p><strong>In my free-time</strong>, I immerse myself in my writing, and in exploring language or art. I’ve
            written a book focused on protecting honey bees, but mainly write just for my own enjoyment. I dabble in
            painting and illustration, as well as wood-working, 3D-printing, and welding.</p>
        <p><strong>Professionally</strong>, I study programming in the hopes of working in software development. I enjoy
            creating small games and programs, learning about algorithms, and designing apps/websites. Recently I’ve
            sparked an interest in learning about cyber-security, and hope to explore that more this fall & winter.
